# Tailwind CSS Extension Installation Guide

## Issue Resolved
The "Unknown at rule @apply css(unknownAtRules)" error has been addressed by disabling CSS validation in VS Code settings.

## Recommended Enhancement
For full Tailwind CSS support including:
- Syntax highlighting for Tailwind classes
- IntelliSense for class names
- Hover previews
- Autocomplete suggestions

### Installation Steps:
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense"
4. Install the extension by Bradlc
5. Reload VS Code

### Extension Benefits:
- Real-time class name validation
- CSS preview on hover
- Emmet-style abbreviations
- Color swatches in editor
- Go to definition support

The settings file `.vscode/settings.json` has been created to disable CSS validation for Tailwind files, which resolves the immediate error.
